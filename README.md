# fullstack23_part3
Repository for Helsinki University's Full Stack Open 2023 course (PART 3).

This repository for part 3 is apart from the main repository due to the recommendation of the course material: 
"NB: It's recommended to do all of the exercises from this part into a new dedicated git repository, and place your source code right at the root of the repository. Otherwise, you will run into problems in exercise 3.10."
